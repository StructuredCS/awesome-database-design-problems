# Awesome Database Design Problems

This is a curated collection of high-quality, real-world database design challenges for students, educators, and self-learners.

This repository aggregates problems from textbooks, university assignments, industry-inspired scenarios, and original case studies. The goal is to provide a practical, structured way to master relational database design, beyond simple SQL queries and into thoughtful schema modeling.

Whether you're preparing for interviews, teaching a course, studying for a class, or just trying to improve your data modeling skills, this collection is here to help.

üîç What's Included:

* ‚úÖ Real-world problem statements with varying complexity
* üìò Source references (e.g., textbooks, universities, open tutorials)
* üéØ Schema design hints and learning objectives
* üß™ Optional solutions and discussion prompts
* üõ†Ô∏è Format suitable for assignments, class projects, or practice

üìö Why Database Design?

* Writing SQL queries is only half the story. Good database design requires:
* Understanding relationships, normalization, and constraints
* Balancing performance with correctness
* Translating messy real-world requirements into clean schema models
* This repo helps you develop the thinking process behind great schema design.

üéì Ideal For

* Computer Science students & instructors
* Backend engineers and data professionals
* Bootcamp learners & self-taught devs
* Interview preparation (system design + DB focus)
