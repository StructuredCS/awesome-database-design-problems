## 📘 Introduction

This is a curated and growing collection of high-quality, real-world database design challenges. This repo is designed for anyone who wants to go beyond writing SQL and focus on the **core skill of data modeling**.

This repository aggregates problems from textbooks, university assignments, industry-inspired scenarios, and original case studies. The goal is to provide a practical, structured way to master relational database design, beyond simple SQL queries and into thoughtful schema modeling. Whether you're preparing for interviews, teaching a course, studying for a class, or just trying to improve your data modeling skills, this collection is here to help.

Each problem comes with a sample solution, often in the form of an ER diagram that adopts the Crow's Foot notation. Why Crow's Foot? Because it is widely recognized and provides a clear, visual representation of entities, attributes, and relationships in a database schema.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- 🧑‍🎓 Computer science and software engineering students
- 👨‍🏫 Educators looking for teaching materials or assignments
- 💼 Developers preparing for system design or database interviews
- 🧪 Self-learners seeking structured practice with schema design
