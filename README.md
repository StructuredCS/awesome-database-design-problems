## üìò Introduction

Welcome! This is a curated and growing collection of high-quality, real-world **database design challenges**. It's built for anyone who wants to go beyond just writing SQL and focus on the **core skill of data modeling**.

The problems here are drawn from textbooks, university assignments, industry-inspired scenarios, and original case studies. The goal is to provide a **practical, structured way to master relational schema design** ‚Äî moving past simple queries into thoughtful, real-world modeling decisions.

Each problem includes a sample solution, typically in the form of an **ER diagram using Crow‚Äôs Foot notation**. Why Crow‚Äôs Foot? Because it‚Äôs clear, widely recognized, and supported by most professional database design tools. It provides an intuitive visual language for modeling entities, attributes, and relationships.

If you're interested in understanding the **why** behind these designs ‚Äî the tradeoffs, the design principles, and the relational theory ‚Äî check out [this **open-access lecture series** on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fg3zQpW0k4UO9eBDLdroADnB18ZAOgj). This video series is based on the book [*Grokking Relational Database Design*](https://mng.bz/PRER), and explores the reasoning behind good schema design, including normalization, cardinality, keys, and common pitfalls.
